      <p>
        I built and shipped and posted... and then nothing.
        <br />
        I thought it was just me.<br />
        It wasn't.
      </p>

      <p>
        If I had this back when I was stuck staring at zero replies,
        <br />
        I would’ve moved way faster and with way less second-guessing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Inside this toolkit, you’ll find answers to the things that had me
        stuck:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>What the hell do I say when I reach out</li>
        <li>Where are my first 10 users even hanging out</li>
        <li>How do I write a landing page that gets clicks</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        If you’ve launched something (even quietly) and felt that sting of
        silence, this is for you.
